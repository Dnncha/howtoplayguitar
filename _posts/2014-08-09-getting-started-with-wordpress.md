You can get Wordpress themes for free, or you can invest in a higher quality, premium theme. The premium themes tend to be a little bit easier to work with, with more customisation options in the dashboard, and they often offer after sale support.  

##Where can I find themes for *free*?

To grab some free themes, head over to [The official Wordpress.org theme directory](http://wordpress.org/themes/).  It's probably the largest collection of free themes and it is well curated. 

Ideally you want to find a theme that mentions responsive design, so that your site loads up properly on mobile devices. There are loads of these available, so that shouldn't be too difficult. 

##Where can I *buy* a theme? 


###Wordpress Theme Marketplaces

There are huge marketplaces for premium Wordpress themes, here are some of the big ones:

[Themeforest](www.themeforest.com)

Themeforest is normally the first marketplace I mention to friends when they are looking for themes. They have a ton of themes and it is easy to preview each theme and look at reviews from customers. Everything in the [featured section](http://themeforest.net/feature) is usually rock solid and easy to work with.   Themes here cost roughly from $10 to $80

[Mojo Themes](http://www.mojo-themes.com/)

Mojo Themes is very similar to Themeforest, it's another theme marketplace. The word on the street (I mean internet) is that it's harder to get themes accepted to Themeforest than Mojo Themes.
