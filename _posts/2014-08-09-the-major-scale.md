##Play slowly

You've heard it 14,000 times today already, but I'm going to say it again: slow down. Play like you are underwater. Give your hands some time to get into place before you try to sound the notes. Tension is the enemy on a guitar, and you won't be able to play quickly at first without getting very tense.  

##Play Equally

Throw on a [metronome](https://www.metronomeonline.com/) and start grooving with it. You might hate this at first, but you're going to have to get used to the whole idea of playing to a click if you're ever going record anything, or play with anyone else, or sound good. You need some kind of click, either out loud, or in your head, that you're grooving with. That's what makes your playing sound professional. Well that and a few other things. But professional musicians have a keen ear for time, and I think you should start playing around with *feel* from the beginning. A metronomic click gives you a lot of feedback about the timing of your playing, so you can more clearly hear how you are *really* phrasing your notes.

##Play in little mini loops

When I can't quite get a phrase down, or a chord change, the way I get past it is by just playing the same phrase slowly, over and over again. It sounds obvious, and it is, frankly. But it does the job for me. Don't worry about playing the whole thing through from start to finish, unless you are obsessed with [FTL.](http://www.ftlgame.com/)
